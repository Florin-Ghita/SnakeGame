# SnakeGame
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Java. The game features a player-controlled snake that moves around a board, eating food to grow longer while avoiding its own tail. The game ends when the snake collides with an obstacle or its own body. The code is designed using object-oriented principles and can be easily modified to add new features or improve existing ones.
